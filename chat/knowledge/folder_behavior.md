# Folder Behavior

Folders are used only for organization.

## Folder operations
• Create folder
• Rename folder
• Delete folder

## Important notes
• Renaming a folder does not re-encrypt files
• Files remain encrypted inside folders
• Deleting a folder deletes all files inside it

## Security
Folder structure does not affect encryption.
Encryption is applied per file, not per folder.
